# Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio


## Description
For this project given the outline of my On-the-job ticket, my main objectives is to:

	•	To further improve upon my existing portfolio layout by revising the look 
        and feel of the layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework, starting for scratch.

	•	To achieve this aim, the experience gained so far from implementing HTML, 
        CSS, Bootstrap Frameworks and thus, committing and deploying project elements through    
        GitHub and GitHub Pages will allow my portfolio of work to be presented and easily 
        accessible to all.


## User Story
    With the above in mind, in re-designing the portfolio layout, through course work a sense of appreciation for identifying common UX design elements and how they effect affect user behaviour was established i and believe successfully implemented. 

	Overall though the observation of User Funnels on other existing websites, one was able to discover how to place strategic anchors to facilitate user anticipation. Hence, initiate an appropriate response. However, building web pages using Bootstrap as a style framework, does not come without challenges and there has few along the way. 

	Most notably, determining and drawing out the initial UI layout and page columns and rows positional sections. Having a Jumbotron feature header is a great tool, but having a designers eye to populate it so that stimulates the user interaction is another. 

	One thing gained from this implementation is how important it is to get the HTML section nesting correct so that the layout being attempted is achieved. As this affects the positioning of text, headings and objects etc. 

	FontAwesome, although new to me, sometimes did not work although the appropriate header references where placed as directed. However, icons8.com turned out to be a lifesaver in some instances allowing to further add some unique changes to the overall appearance of the page. Getting links to manoeuvre about the page to correct locations and directed elsewhere was another challenge met but overcome through research.
